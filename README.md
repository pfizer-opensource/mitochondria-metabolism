# mitochondria_metabolism
This is a mechanistic model of myocardial mitochondrial metabolism including oxidative phosphorylation, $\beta$-oxidation, TCA cycle, metaboilte transport and electrophysiology. The model is used to evaluate how substrate selection influences myocardial energetics at rest and during exercise under healthy and heart failure conditions.
